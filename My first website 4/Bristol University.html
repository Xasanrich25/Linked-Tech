<h2>Bristol University</h2>
<p>
    The University of Bristol is a red brick Russell Group research university in Bristol, England. It received its royal charter in 1909, although it can trace its roots to a Merchant Venturers' school founded in 1595 and University College, Bristol, which had been in existence since 1876.
    Bristol is organised into six academic faculties composed of multiple schools and departments running over 200 undergraduate courses, largely in the Tyndalls Park area of the city. The university had a total income of £752.0 million in 2020–21, of which £169.8 million was from research grants and contracts. It is the largest independent employer in Bristol. Current academics include 21 fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences, 13 fellows of the British Academy, 13 fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering and 44 fellows of the Royal Society.Among alumni and faculty, the university counts 9 Nobel laureates

        This impressive building is located at the top of Queens Road, and was built in 1841 in a classical Greek revival style with a dramatic Corinthian portico supported by eight columns.
        Now home to the University’s Music Department, the Victoria Rooms is perfect for larger conferences, as it can seat 500 in the auditorium, and there several additional function rooms, including a lecture theatre and a recital room. The auditorium is perfect for concerts, and the recently acquired tiered stage is ideal for choir performances.
        The Victoria Rooms are available outside of teaching hours only.
